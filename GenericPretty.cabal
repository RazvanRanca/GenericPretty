Synopsis:            A generic, derivable, haskell pretty printer.

-- A longer description of the package.
Description: 
  GenericPretty is a Haskell library that supports automatic
  derivation of pretty printing functions on user defined data
  types.
  .
  The form of geenrics used is based on that introduced in the paper:
  Magalhaes, Dijkstra, Jeuring, and Loh,
  A Generic Deriving Mechanism for Haskell,
  3'rd ACM Symposium on Haskell, pp. 37-48, September 2010,
  <http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1863523.1863529>.
  Changes from the original paper in the GHC implementation
  are described here:
  <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC.Generics#Changes_from_the_paper>.
  .
  This package requires the use of the new GHC.Generics features
  <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC.Generics>, present from GHC 7.2.
  Use of these features is indicated by the DeriveGeneric pragma.
  or the flag -XDeriveGeneric.
  .
  Pretty printing produces values of type Text.PrettyPrint.Doc, using
  the Text.PrettyPrint library
  <http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/pretty-1.1.1.0/Text-PrettyPrint.html>.
  .
  The output provided is a pretty printed version of that provided by
  Prelude.show.  That is, rendering the document provided by this pretty
  printer yields an output identical to that of Prelude.show, except
  for extra whitespace.
  .
  For information about the functions exported by the package please see
  the API linked further down this page.
  
  For examples of usage, both basic and more complex see the README file and
  the haskell source code files in the TestSuite folder, both included in the package.
